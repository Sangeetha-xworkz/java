1)Polymorphism:When an object behaves differntlly at given instance of time is called Polymorphism.
if we take a real time example a person is son for his parent,husband for his wife and father for is children in differnt time he behavies differntly.

to achieve Polymorphism inheritance must be present.
There are 2 types of Polymorphism
1)Compile time Polymorphism:Decision of invoking a method decides at compile time is called compile time Polymorphism.
we can achieve Compile time polymorphism when there is a method overloading happens.
2)Run time Polymorphism:Decision of invoking a method decides at run time is called run time Polymorphism. 
we can achieve run time polymorphism when method overriding is present.

3)Inheritance:The process of accquering the properties from one class to another class or from base class to derived class or parent class to child class.
we can achieve inheritance by using a keyword extends
*types of Inheritance
Single level inheritance:single parent and single child
hybrid inheritance:single parent two child
hirarchical inheritance:single parent multiple childs
mutiple inheritance:is not possible because child can inherit parent properties but parent never inherit the proprties of child.

Inheritance is also calles as is a relationship ,Savings Account is a child of Bank.
eg:like we have a bank which is a parent class and savings account and current account are the child of bank
where they inherit properties from there parent class.


4)Encapsulation:The process grouping the different types of data into a single block or a unit.
it can be achieved by using a keyword private.
encapsulation fallows 4 rules
1)public class must be present
2)private keyword
3)getter and setter methods must be public we need to access the data through this methods
4)main method to execute
the main purpose of encapsulation is to provide security for the data.

3)Constructor Chaining
Constructor chaining will present when we have has a relationship.
has a relationship is nothing but one class is dependent on other class.
  public City()//has it information
  public Distict(City)
  public Country(Distict)
  public State(Country)
  public Address(State)
  patientAddress
